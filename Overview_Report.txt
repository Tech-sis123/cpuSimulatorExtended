This report documents the comprehensive modification and enhancement of a web-based Central Processing Unit (CPU) simulator.
The project aimed to extend a basic instruction set architecture (ISA) to include advanced arithmetic and logical operations, 
complex addressing modes, and flow control mechanisms. 
Specifically, the implementation of SUB, MUL, DIV, AND, OR, and NOT instructions, 
alongside Immediate, Register-Indirect, and Indexed addressing modes, significantly broadens the computational capabilities of the simulator. 
Furthermore, the introduction of a Zero Flag (ZF) and a conditional jump instruction (JNZ) enables the execution of iterative algorithms. 
An optional system bus visualization was also integrated to provide a real-time graphical representation of the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle. 
This report details the system architecture, software design patterns, implementation logic, verification methodologies, and a critical evaluation of the final deliverable.
